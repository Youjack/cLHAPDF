This is a C wrapper of the C++ [LHAPDF](https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/).

A Julia wrapper of the C wrapper is also provided.

This is inspired by [cbpark/lhapdf-wrapper-test](https://github.com/cbpark/lhapdf-wrapper-test).

This is tested on macOS 15 on Apple Silicon with LHAPDF 6.5.5 and Julia 1.11.
